## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### User Goals

        1. As a player, I want to be able to click on a cookie to earn points, so I can feel a sense of accomplishment and progress in the game.
        2. As a player, I want to see my total number of cookies earned displayed prominently on the screen, so I can track my progress and strive to earn more cookies.
        3. As a player, I want to have the option to purchase upgrades and enhancements using my cookies, so I can increase my cookie production rate and progress faster in the game.
        4. As a player, I want to be able to unlock achievements for reaching certain milestones or completing specific tasks, so I can feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.
        5. As a player, I want to have a responsive and intuitive user interface that works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, so I can enjoy the game whether I'm playing on my computer, tablet, or smartphone.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I used [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co) to find a colour palette I felt went well with the design of the website. This is the [Colour Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/0032852a629aff7f3effda78) that I ended up chosing and these will be featured throughout the website.

    -   #### Typography
        -   I kept the font simple and uniform throughout using the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font family for all of the text. I feel if gives a clean feel to the text throughout the page.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   I used images that went with a Kitchen theme where the cookies would be baked. Clicking the cookie in the 'kitchen', buying upgrades from the 'store' and keeping them in you 'pantry' to a recipe book on how to make the cookies (play the game). I felt the images used really tie in the elements on the page and gives it a whole feel. All Images were created using [Dream Studio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/generate)

## Lighthouse Scores

![Lighthouse Scores](/assets/images/Lighthouse.PNG "Lighthouse Scores")

The 95 score in performace I believe is due to the amount of Images involved in the Cookie Clicker game, for example each achievement has 2 images, one coloured one blacked out which are then switched using Javascript.

The 95 score in accessibility is due to using Headers out of order througout the page.

### Known Bugs

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StephenIles/OneLife-Milestone-Project-1-)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. In the menu on the left click on "Pages".
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "main".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Change the folder from "/root" to "/docs"
7. The page will automatically refresh
8. At the top of the page there will be a link to Visit the website.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StephenIles/OneLife-Milestone-Project-1-)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StephenIles/OneLife-Milestone-Project-1-)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
