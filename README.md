-   ### User stories

    -   #### User Goals

        1. As a player, I want to be able to click on a cookie to earn points, so I can feel a sense of accomplishment and progress in the game.
        2. As a player, I want to see my total number of cookies earned displayed prominently on the screen, so I can track my progress and strive to earn more cookies.
        3. As a player, I want to have the option to purchase upgrades and enhancements using my cookies, so I can increase my cookie production rate and progress faster in the game.
        4. As a player, I want to be able to unlock achievements for reaching certain milestones or completing specific tasks, so I can feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.
        5. As a player, I want to have a responsive and intuitive user interface that works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, so I can enjoy the game whether I'm playing on my computer, tablet, or smartphone.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I used [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co) to find a colour palette I felt went well with the design of the website. This is the [Colour Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/0032852a629aff7f3effda78) that I ended up chosing and these will be featured throughout the website.

    -   #### Typography
        -   I kept the font simple and uniform throughout using the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font family for all of the text. I feel if gives a clean feel to the text throughout the page.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   I used images that went with a Kitchen theme where the cookies would be baked. Clicking the cookie in the 'kitchen', buying upgrades from the 'store' and keeping them in you 'pantry' to a recipe book on how to make the cookies (play the game). I felt the images used really tie in the elements on the page and gives it a whole feel. All Images were created using [Dream Studio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/generate)

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

### Results

The warnings found in the JSLint image above are from not declaring the 'document' 'setTimeout' and 'setInterval', using the => function shortcut and oversized character lines.

## Testing Table

### Element Testing

Testing the HTML elements on the page making sure they all do what they are supposed to do.

| Item | What should happen? | Does it Pass or Fail |

## Lighthouse Scores

![Lighthouse Scores](/assets/images/Lighthouse.PNG "Lighthouse Scores")

The 95 score in performace I believe is due to the amount of Images involved in the Cookie Clicker game, for example each achievement has 2 images, one coloured one blacked out which are then switched using Javascript.

The 95 score in accessibility is due to using Headers out of order througout the page.
